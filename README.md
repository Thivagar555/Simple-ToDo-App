## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to build a complete browser-based application using just frontend technologies.  
I learned how to dynamically create and update elements using JavaScript and how to make data persist using the localStorage API.  
It also taught me the importance of user experience, clean UI, and how small frontend projects are structured.
